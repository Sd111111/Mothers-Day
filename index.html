    <p id="para">No matter how old you are, there's one Mother's Day gift that she'll always love: a sweet, heartfelt card! Sure, she'll appreciate breakfast in bed or a Mother's Day lunch, but a card filled with one of these heartfelt Mother's Day messages is something she can keep forever. For Ree Drummond, now that her kids are off in different directions, she says she's "thrilled" come Mother's Day "with a kiss on the cheek from whatever child is around that day!" Reminding your mom how much she means to you is something anyone of any age can do, whether you're celebrating together or apart.
      <br></br>
These cute, meaningful, and even funny Mother's Day wishes are the perfect inspiration. Whether the mom in your life is your own mother, grandmother, or someone who is just like a mom to you, these sayings will be the perfect match. Make sure her day starts off right by sending a cute message over text first thing in the morning and following it later in the day with a DIY card. And if you're mailing your Mother's Day card, make sure you know when Mother's Day is so it gets there in time! Sending a physical card means that they can carry these Mother's Day wishes with them always.</p>
